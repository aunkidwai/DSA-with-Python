### **Time Complexity and Big O Notation**

#### **Introduction to Time Complexity**
Time complexity is a computational concept that provides an estimate of the time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. It helps us understand the scalability of an algorithm and is crucial for determining whether an algorithm is suitable for large datasets. Time complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper limit or worst-case scenario of an algorithm's running time.

### **Big O Notation**

Big O notation provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's time complexity by focusing on the most significant factors that affect the algorithm's performance as the input size grows.

#### **1. O(1): Constant Time**
- **Description**: An algorithm with O(1) time complexity takes the same amount of time to execute regardless of the input size. This means that the algorithm's running time does not change with the size of the input data.
- **Example**: Accessing an element in an array by its index.

```python
def get_first_element(arr):
    return arr[0]  # Constant time operation

# Example usage
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(get_first_element(arr))  # Output: 10
```

- **Explanation**: No matter how large the array is, accessing the first element always takes the same amount of time.

#### **2. O(log n): Logarithmic Time**
- **Description**: An algorithm with O(log n) time complexity reduces the problem size with each step, often by dividing the problem into smaller parts. Logarithmic time complexity is typically seen in divide-and-conquer algorithms, such as binary search.
- **Example**: Binary search on a sorted array.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(binary_search(arr, 30))  # Output: 2
```

- **Explanation**: With each step, binary search cuts the search space in half, leading to logarithmic time complexity.

#### **3. O(n): Linear Time**
- **Description**: An algorithm with O(n) time complexity has a running time directly proportional to the size of the input. As the input size doubles, the time required to complete the algorithm also doubles.
- **Example**: Linear search through an array.

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(linear_search(arr, 30))  # Output: 2
```

- **Explanation**: The time required to search through the array increases linearly with the size of the array.

#### **4. O(n log n): Log-Linear Time**
- **Description**: An algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity is more complex than linear time but more efficient than quadratic time. It is typically seen in efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
- **Example**: Merge sort algorithm.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

# Example usage
arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
merge_sort(arr)
print(arr)  # Output: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
```

- **Explanation**: Merge sort divides the array into halves (log n divisions) and then merges the sorted halves (n operations), resulting in an O(n log n) time complexity.

#### **5. O(n^2): Quadratic Time**
- **Description**: An algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity has a running time proportional to the square of the input size. This complexity is common in algorithms that involve nested loops, where each element is compared with every other element.
- **Example**: Bubble sort algorithm.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
print(arr)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

- **Explanation**: Bubble sort compares each element with every other element, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).
